# AASTyp

An unofficial port of AASTeXv7 (official LaTeX journal template for the American Astronomical Society) to Typst. As of right now, this template is not intended to be a one-to-one recreation of the AASTeX format. Rather, AASTyp aims to capture all of AASTeX's important components in an aesthetically pleasing and author-friendly way.

Basic features include:
- Automatic title, author, abstract, and keywords formatting
- Page headers with an optional short title
- Toggleable line numbering, watermark, and two column mode

Planned features include:
- Comprehensive documentation (including Typst comments and manuscript content)
- Custom table options (similar to AASTeX's `deluxetable`)
- Anonymization (e.g., for peer review)
- AAS bibliography and citation style

# Basic Usage

The easiest way to get started with AASTyp is to edit the example `main.typ` file, which is preloaded with default values. Comments in the Typst file indicate how the template is meant to be used.
